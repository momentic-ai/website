# AI actions

## Introduction

**AI actions** transform human-understandable goals into groups of [preset commands](/docs/step-types/preset-actions). When an AI action is invoked, our web agent continuously generates and runs preset commands until the specified goal has been achieved. For example, the goal "add ice cream to my cart" on a shopping page may transform into a series of clicks.

Since they are powered by LLMs instead of hardcoded [selectors](https://playwright.dev/docs/other-locators), AI actions are **self-healing**, adapting automatically to minor changes to your website without human involvement. We recommend using AI actions to complete user flows such as logins, searches, and checkouts where the specific actions taken are not as important as being able to accomplish the goal.

## Creating an AI action

<span style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>

  </Frame>
</span>
<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <i>Initial configuration of an AI action</i>
</div>

The configuration for an AI action consists only of the goal that should be achieved. The prompt should include any variables required to complete the task, such as credentials ("login using `mypassword`"), descriptors ("add a 128GB iPad to my cart"), and option choices ("decline all add-ons and checkout").

Once you have drafted an prompt, click the play button to run the action. You will begin to see Momentic's web agent generate and execute commands:

</span>
<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>

    Web agent generating commands. You cannot modify the test while it's
    running.
  </i>
</div>

The web agent will continue generating commands until it believes your goal has been accomplished, at which point it will output a special `Done` command that is only allowed at the end of AI actions and cannot be moved. If the agent is acting unexpectedly, you can click `Cancel Execution` and [manually tune](#tuning-ai-actions) the sequence of commands.

  </Frame>
</span>
<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <i>A fully completed AI action</i>
</div>

## Adding a success condition

When first ran, AI actions will always end with a `Done` command that has a blank `Success condition`. This means that, on subseqeunt runs, 

## Tuning AI actions

If the web agent chooses an incorrect sequence of commands, there are two ways to tune the AI action.

### Changing the prompt

### Changing individual commands
