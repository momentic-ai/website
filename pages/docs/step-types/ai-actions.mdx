# AI actions

## Introduction

**AI actions** transform high level goals into groups of [preset commands](/docs/step-types/preset-actions). When an AI action is invoked, our web agent continuously generates and runs preset commands until the specified goal has been achieved. We recommend using AI actions to test broad user flows such as logins, searches, and checkouts where the specific actions taken are not as important as being able to accomplish a goal.

Since they are powered by LLMs instead of hardcoded [selectors](https://playwright.dev/docs/other-locators), AI actions are **self-healing**, adapting automatically to minor changes to your website without human involvement. The power and flexibility of AI actions is what makes Momentic tests 10X faster to author and maintain compared to traditional platforms.
