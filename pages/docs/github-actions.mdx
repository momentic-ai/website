# GitHub Actions

<Callout type="info">
  While we recommend using the [SDK](/docs/sdk) for most use cases, you can also
  use our GitHub action to integrate with your CI/CD pipeline.
</Callout>

## Usage

You can view the Momentic action on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/momentic-run-tests).
Make sure to generate an API key in the Momentic app first. Set it as an environment variable `MOMENTIC_API_KEY`.

```yaml
name: Test

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  run-tests:
    name: Run tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - name: Run tests using Momentic
        uses: momentic-ai/run-tests@v1
        env:
          MOMENTIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MOMENTIC_API_KEY }}
        with:
          tests: |-
            8f20cad6-2fd5-4019-bcbc-26fb617f36c5
```
