# GitHub Actions

While we recommend using the [SDK](/docs/sdk) for most use cases, you can also use our GitHub action to integrate with your CI/CD pipeline.

## Usage

You can view the Momentic action on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/momentic-run-tests).
Make sure to generate an API key in the Momentic app first. Set it as an environment variable `MOMENTIC_API_KEY`.

```yaml copy
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
- name: Run tests using Momentic
  uses: momentic-ai/run-tests@v1
  env:
    MOMENTIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MOMENTIC_API_KEY }}
  with:
    tests: |-
      8f20cad6-2fd5-4019-bcbc-26fb617f36c5
```
