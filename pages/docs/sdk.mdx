</Callout>

The [Momentic SDK](https://github.com/momentic-ai/sdk) is a [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/momentic) that allows you to easily integrate Momentic's AI into your application and workflows.

## CLI Usage

Make sure to generate an API key in the Momentic app first. You can pass it as a parameter to the CLI or set it as an environment variable `MOMENTIC_API_KEY`. For help run `npx momentic@latest --help`.

### Running tests remotely

This is similar to running tests via webhook. The CLI will queue the tests to be run.

```bash copy
npx momentic@latest run-tests --remote --tests c2c2fee4-4778-4bbb-8f0c-31f25f774726 5fed69c1-1a9b-47d1-8d10-afc0c587d8dd
```

### Running tests locally or in CI

This will automatically start a local web server and run the tests against it. It will replace the base URL of the tests with the local web server URL.

```bash copy
# Make sure to install the browsers first
npx momentic@latest install-browsers
```

Use the `--start` flag to start the local web server before running the tests. Use the `--wait-on` flag to wait for the web server to be ready before running the tests.

```bash copy
npx momentic@latest run-tests --local --start "npm run start" --wait-on http://localhost:3000 --tests c2c2fee4-4778-4bbb-8f0c-31f25f774726
```

### GitHub Actions example

This is an example of how to run tests in GitHub Actions. Make sure to set the `MOMENTIC_API_KEY` secret in your repository settings.

```yaml copy
name: Test

env:
  MOMENTIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MOMENTIC_API_KEY }}

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  run-tests:
    name: Run tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 21
      - run: npm install
      - run: npx momentic@latest install-browsers
      - run: npx momentic@latest run-tests --local --start "npm run start" --wait-on http://localhost:3000 --tests c2c2fee4-4778-4bbb-8f0c-31f25f774726
      - run: npx momentic@latest run-tests --remote --tests c2c2fee4-4778-4bbb-8f0c-31f25f774726
```
