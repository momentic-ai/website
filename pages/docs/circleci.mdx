# CircleCI

While we recommend using the [SDK](/docs/sdk) for most use cases, you can also use our CircleCI orb to integrate with your CI/CD pipeline.

## Usage

You can view the Momentic orb on the [Developer Hub](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/momentic-ai/momentic-ai).
Make sure to generate an API key in the Momentic app first. You can pass it as a parameter to the command as `api_key` or set it as an environment variable `MOMENTIC_API_KEY`.

```yaml copy
version: "2.1"

orbs:
  momentic: momentic-ai/momentic-ai@1

jobs:
  test-deploy:
    steps:
      - momentic-ai/run-tests:
          tests: |
            82143d83-d06f-4f05-98f4-f81a694dd23f
