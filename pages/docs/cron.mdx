When configuring a test, you can set a schedule for it to run on. This can be done by clicking the "Schedule" button in the top right corner of the test editor.

Cron expressions are used to define the schedule. You can use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to help you build your expression. Make sure to select the correct time zone for your schedule.
