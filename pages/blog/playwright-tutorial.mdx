**6. Create a Test File: Structuring Your Playwright Tests for Success**
In the realm of Playwright testing, a crucial step is creating a dedicated test file to organize and execute your automated tests seamlessly. Crafting an efficient test file not only enhances the maintainability of your test suite but also contributes to a smoother testing workflow.

Create a new file (e.g., test.spec.js) where you'll write your Playwright tests. Here's a simple example:

```js
const { test, expect } = require("@playwright/test");

test("Basic test example", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("https://novu.co/");
  const title = await page.title();
  expect(title).toBe("Novu - The open-source notification infrastructure");
});
```

## Best Practices for Writing Playwright Test Files:

Writing effective and maintainable Playwright test files involves following best practices to ensure the reliability and scalability of your test suite. Here are some best practices for writing Playwright test files:

**Organize Test Cases:**

- Structure your test files logically, grouping them based on functionality or modules.

- Use a naming convention that clearly identifies the purpose of each test file.

```js
// test/authentication.test.js

describe("Authentication Tests", () => {
  // Test cases for login functionality
  it("should allow a user to login successfully", async () => {
    // Test implementation...
  });

  it("should display an error message for invalid credentials", async () => {
    // Test implementation...
  });
});
```

**Use Descriptive Test Names:**

- Provide meaningful and descriptive names for your test cases. This makes it easier to understand the purpose of each test and helps in debugging.

```js
it("should allow a user to login successfully", async () => {
  // Test implementation...
});

it("should display an error message for invalid credentials", async () => {
  // Test implementation...
});
```

**Modularize Test Code:**

- Break down your tests into modular components or functions. This promotes code reuse and makes it easier to maintain and update your test suite.

```js
// utils/authenticationUtils.js

async function loginUser(page, username, password) {
  // Implementation for login functionality...
}

module.exports = { loginUser };
```

```js
// test/authentication.test.js

const { loginUser } = require("../utils/authenticationUtils");

it("should allow a user to login successfully", async () => {
  await loginUser(page, "validUsername", "validPassword");
  // Assertions...
});

it("should display an error message for invalid credentials", async () => {
  await loginUser(page, "invalidUsername", "invalidPassword");
  // Assertions...
});
```

**Setup and Teardown:**

- Leverage the _beforeAll_, _beforeEach_, _afterEach_, and _afterAll_ hooks for setup and teardown tasks.
- Properly manage the browser context, ensuring a clean state before each test.

```js
beforeAll(async () => {
  // Setup browser and context...
});

afterAll(async () => {
  // Teardown browser and context...
});
```

**Parameterize Tests:**

- Parameterize your test cases to run with different sets of data. This helps maximize test coverage without duplicating code.

```js
const credentials = [
  { username: "validUsername", password: "validPassword" },
  { username: "invalidUsername", password: "invalidPassword" },
];

it.each(credentials)(
  "should handle login with %s credentials",
  async (cred) => {
    await loginUser(page, cred.username, cred.password);
    // Assertions...
  },
);
```

**Handle Asynchronous Operations:**

- Be mindful of Playwright's asynchronous nature. Utilize async and await to handle promises gracefully.
- Use the built-in functions like _waitFor_, _waitForSelector_, and _waitForTimeout_ for synchronization.

```js
it("should allow a user to login successfully", async () => {
  await loginUser(page, "validUsername", "validPassword");
  await page.waitForSelector("#dashboard");
  // Assertions...
});
```

**Use Page Objects:**

- Implement the Page Object Model (POM) to encapsulate the interaction with pages and components. This promotes code maintainability and reusability.

```js
// pageObjects/LoginPage.js

class LoginPage {
  constructor(page) {
    this.page = page;
  }

  async login(username, password) {
    // Implementation for login functionality...
  }

  // Additional methods...
}

module.exports = LoginPage;
```

```js
// test/authentication.test.js

const LoginPage = require("../pageObjects/LoginPage");
const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);

it("should allow a user to login successfully", async () => {
  await loginPage.login("validUsername", "validPassword");
  // Assertions...
});
```

## Let's see some code in action 👀

**Example 1: Open a browser and navigate to a website**

```js
// Importing the 'chromium' object from the 'playwright' library.
const { chromium } = require("playwright");

// Asynchronous function to launch a Chromium browser, navigate to a website, and then close the browser.
(async () => {
  // Launching a new Chromium browser instance.
  const browser = await chromium.launch();

  // Creating a new page within the browser.
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigating to the 'https://example.com' website.
  await page.goto("https://example.com");

  // Closing the Chromium browser.
  await browser.close();
})();
```

**Example 2: Fill out a form and take a screenshot**

```js
const { chromium } = require("playwright");

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto("https://example.com");

  // Fill out a form
  await page.fill('input[name="username"]', "your_username");
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', "your_password");

  // Take a screenshot
  await page.screenshot({ path: "example.png" });

  await browser.close();
})();
```

**Example 3: Clicking a button and handling navigation**

```js
const { chromium } = require("playwright");

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto("https://example.com");

  // Click a button
  await page.click("button#submit-button");

  // Wait for navigation
  await page.waitForNavigation();

  // Verify the new page URL
  console.log(`Current URL: ${page.url()}`);

  await browser.close();
})();
```

**Example 4: Evaluate page content**

```js
const { chromium } = require("playwright");

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto("https://example.com");

  // Evaluate page content
  const title = await page.title();
  console.log(`Page title: ${title}`);

  const paragraphText = await page.$eval("p", (p) => p.textContent);
  console.log(`Paragraph text: ${paragraphText}`);

  await browser.close();
})();
```

**Ugh! Enough of theoretical code 😵**

Let's see some real action 🤩

Let's test text elements on the Novu Page. (Novu is opensource infrastructure for developers 🚨)

```js
// Importing necessary functions and modules from Playwright test library
import test, { page, expect } from "@playwright/test";
import { describe } from "node:test";

// Defining a test suite with a description
describe("Nohu test ", () => {
  // Test case for "Get started button"
  test("Get started button", async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigating to the specified URL
    await page.goto("https://novu.co/");

    // Pausing the test execution for debugging purposes
    await page.pause();

    // Using expect to assert that a link with role "Get Started" exists and has the text "Get Started"
    await expect(
      page.getByRole("link", { name: "Get Started" }).nth(1),
    ).toHaveText("Get Started");

    // Checking if an element with text "Get Started" exists and clicking on it if it does
    if (await page.$("text=Get Started")) {
      await page.locator("text=Get Started").nth(1).click();
    }
  });

  // Test case for "Book a demo button"
  test("Book a demo button", async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigating to the specified URL
    await page.goto("https://novu.co/");

    // Pausing the test execution for debugging purposes
    await page.pause();

    // Checking if an element with text "star us" exists and clicking on it if it does
    if (await page.$("text=star us")) {
      await page.locator("text=star us").nth(1).click();
    }

    // Intentionally failing the test by asserting that a heading has the text "ABCD"
    // This line is marked to intentionally fail the test for demonstration purposes
    await expect(
      page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Used by innovative companies" }),
    ).toHaveText("ABCD");
  });
});
```
