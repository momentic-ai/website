## What the heck is Playwright?
Software testing is a critical phase in the software development life cycle, ensuring that applications meet specified requirements and function as intended. Playwright, an open-source automation framework developed by Microsoft, has become a valuable tool in the field of software testing. Here's a brief overview of how Playwright facilitates effective software testing 



## How to Install Playwright ? 

Get started by installing Playwright using npm , yarn or pnpm.

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn","pnpm"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
 ```bash
  npm init playwright@latest
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```bash
yarn create playwright
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```bash
pnpm create playwright
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Create a Test File: Structuring Your Playwright Tests for Success
In the realm of Playwright testing, a crucial step is creating a dedicated test file to organize and execute your automated tests seamlessly. Crafting an efficient test file not only enhances the maintainability of your test suite but also contributes to a smoother testing workflow.

Create a new file (e.g., test.spec.js) where you'll write your Playwright tests. Here's a simple example:

```js
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('Basic test example', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  const title = await page.title();
  expect(title).toBe('Example Domain');
});
```


## Best Practices for Writing Playwright Test Files:

**Organize Test Cases:** Arrange your test cases logically within the test file, making it easy to comprehend the flow of your test scenarios. Well-organized tests not only assist in troubleshooting but also set the foundation for scalability.

**Use Descriptive Test Names:** Choose clear and descriptive names for your test functions. This not only aids fellow developers in understanding the purpose of each test but also helps search engines recognize the relevance of your content.

**Implement Page Navigation:** Leverage Playwright's powerful capabilities to navigate through web pages efficiently. Incorporate **page.goto()** to initiate navigation, enhancing the realism of your tests and providing valuable insights into the behavior of your web application.


## Let's see some code in action ðŸ‘€

**Example 1: Open a browser and navigate to a website**
```js
// Importing the 'chromium' object from the 'playwright' library.
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

// Asynchronous function to launch a Chromium browser, navigate to a website, and then close the browser.
(async () => {
  // Launching a new Chromium browser instance.
  const browser = await chromium.launch();

  // Creating a new page within the browser.
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigating to the 'https://example.com' website.
  await page.goto('https://example.com');

  // Closing the Chromium browser.
  await browser.close();
})();
```

**Example 2: Fill out a form and take a screenshot**
```js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  
  // Fill out a form
  await page.fill('input[name="username"]', 'your_username');
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'your_password');
  
  // Take a screenshot
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'example.png' });
  
  await browser.close();
})();

```

**Example 3: Clicking a button and handling navigation**
```js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  
  // Click a button
  await page.click('button#submit-button');
  
  // Wait for navigation
  await page.waitForNavigation();
  
  // Verify the new page URL
  console.log(`Current URL: ${page.url()}`);
  
  await browser.close();
})();
```

**Example 4: Evaluate page content**
```js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  
  // Evaluate page content
  const title = await page.title();
  console.log(`Page title: ${title}`);
  
  const paragraphText = await page.$eval('p', (p) => p.textContent);
  console.log(`Paragraph text: ${paragraphText}`);
  
  await browser.close();
})();

```

**Ugh! Enough of theoretical code ðŸ˜µ**

Let's see some real action ðŸ¤©

Let's test text elements on the Novu Page. (Novu is opensource infrastructure for developers ðŸš¨)

```js
// Importing necessary functions and modules from Playwright test library
import test, { page, expect } from "@playwright/test";
import { describe } from "node:test";

// Defining a test suite with a description
describe("Nohu test ", () => {
  
  // Test case for "Get started button"
  test("Get started button", async ({ page }) => {
    
    // Navigating to the specified URL
    await page.goto("https://novu.co/");

    // Pausing the test execution for debugging purposes
    await page.pause();

    // Using expect to assert that a link with role "Get Started" exists and has the text "Get Started"
    await expect(
      page.getByRole("link", { name: "Get Started" }).nth(1)
    ).toHaveText("Get Started");

    // Checking if an element with text "Get Started" exists and clicking on it if it does
    if (await page.$("text=Get Started")) {
      await page.locator("text=Get Started").nth(1).click();
    }
  });

  // Test case for "Book a demo button"
  test("Book a demo button", async ({ page }) => {
    
    // Navigating to the specified URL
    await page.goto("https://novu.co/");

    // Pausing the test execution for debugging purposes
    await page.pause();

    // Checking if an element with text "star us" exists and clicking on it if it does
    if (await page.$("text=star us")) {
      await page.locator("text=star us").nth(1).click();
    }

    // Intentionally failing the test by asserting that a heading has the text "ABCD"
    // This line is marked to intentionally fail the test for demonstration purposes
    await expect(
      page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Used by innovative companies" })
    ).toHaveText("ABCD");
  });
});

```
